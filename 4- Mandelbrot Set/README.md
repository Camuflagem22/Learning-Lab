# Mandelbrot Fractal  - Love2D

This project creates a render of the infamous **Mandelbrot Set** and draws it to a canvas.

The canvas is then simply drawn to the screen, to avoid having to render the whole thing again at every `love.draw()` call.


This project was my first contact with booth the **Canvas** feature on Love2D, and with **Recursion**.


## How to use

You must have Love2D installed on your machine.

Please note that this is a  `.lua`  file, so this program is run using the Love2D extension for VSCode.

Simply install it, and press  `ALT + L`  to run your program.
