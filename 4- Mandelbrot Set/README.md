# Mandelbrot Fractal  - Love2D

This project creates a render of the infamous **Mandelbrot Set** and draws it to a canvas.

The canvas is then simply drawn to the screen, to avoid having to render the whole thing again at every `love.draw()` call.


This project was my first contact with booth the **Canvas** feature on Love2D, and with **Recursion**.

## Julia Sets

With a few tewaks to the code it's also possible to get some amazing renders of Julia Sets
